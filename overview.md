# Project Overview

This project is a fully responsive Static Portfolio Website created using only HTML and CSS. The purpose of the website is to serve as a personal portfolio for showcasing academic work, technical projects, and essential contact information. The design follows a clean, modern, and minimalistic aesthetic that is easy to navigate and visually appealing.

The project demonstrates fundamental frontend development skills such as semantic HTML structuring, reusable CSS components, layout design, and mobile-first responsiveness. The website includes a hero section with a title and navigation menu, an About Me section describing the creator, a Projects section highlighting sample works, and a Contact section for professional communication.

This project also reflects an understanding of software development workflows, including project setup in Visual Studio Code, using Git for version control, maintaining a structured repository, writing documentation, and hosting code on GitHub.
