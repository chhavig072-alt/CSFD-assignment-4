# Project Overview
This project is a fully responsive Static Portfolio Website created using only HTML and CSS. The purpose of the website is to serve as a personal portfolio for showcasing academic work, technical projects, and essential contact information. The design follows a clean, modern, and minimalistic aesthetic that is easy to navigate and visually appealing.
The project demonstrates fundamental frontend development skills such as semantic HTML structuring, reusable CSS components, layout design, and mobile-first responsiveness. The website includes a hero section with a title and navigation menu, an About Me section describing the creator, a Projects section highlighting sample works, and a Contact section for professional communication.
This project also reflects an understanding of software development workflows, including project setup in Visual Studio Code, using Git for version control, maintaining a structured repository, writing documentation, and hosting code on GitHub.

# Development Process
The development of this static portfolio website followed a systematic and professional workflow. The project began with setting up a new folder in Visual Studio Code, where the HTML and CSS files were created. The structure of the website was planned to ensure good readability, easy navigation, and a clean layout. Semantic HTML tags such as <header>, <nav>, <section>, and <footer> were used to maintain best coding practices.
CSS was written with a focus on responsive design, ensuring that the website looks good on both mobile and desktop screens. A combination of modern UI elements—like card components, a gradient hero section, and subtle shadows—was added to give the website a polished look. Media queries were used to improve the layout for larger screens.
Git was used throughout the development process. The repository was initialized using git init, after which all files were added and committed with clear, descriptive messages. Multiple commits allowed tracking of progress and changes. The project was then pushed to a GitHub repository for hosting and submission.
Documentation was created in a separate docs/ folder to explain the project overview, the workflow, and future enhancements. This documentation supports the assignment requirement of demonstrating understanding of tools and collaboration practices.

# Future Improvements
Although the current version of the portfolio website is fully functional, several enhancements can be made in the future to make it more interactive and visually dynamic. One of the major improvements involves adding JavaScript functionality for animations, transitions, and interactive elements such as dropdown menus, modals, or a dark-mode toggle.
Another planned improvement is expanding the Projects section into a dedicated page where each project can have its own detailed write-up, screenshots, GitHub links, and live demos. This will turn the portfolio into a more professional showcase, helpful for internships and placements.
Additionally, deploying the website using GitHub Pages or Netlify would allow others to access the live version easily. Integrating form services like EmailJS or Formspree could enable functional contact forms without requiring a backend server. A downloadable PDF resume section may also be added.
These improvements will help transform this simple initial portfolio into a fully featured personal website.

⭐ ✔ UPDATED README SECTION: Git Commands + Explanation
Add this under a heading called “Version Control Workflow (Git)”:
## Version Control Workflow (Git)

The project was developed using Git for version control.  
Below are the main commands used during development:

# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Stage all project files for the first commit
git add .

# Commit the staged files with a meaningful message
git commit -m "Initial commit: added project structure"

# Add the GitHub repository as the remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/chhavig072-alt/CSFD-assignment-4.git

# Push all commits to the main branch on GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# Additional commits during development
git add .
git commit -m "Updated layout and added documentation"
git push
