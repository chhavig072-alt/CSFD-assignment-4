# Development Process

The development of this static portfolio website followed a systematic and professional workflow. The project began with setting up a new folder in Visual Studio Code, where the HTML and CSS files were created. The structure of the website was planned to ensure good readability, easy navigation, and a clean layout. Semantic HTML tags such as <header>, <nav>, <section>, and <footer> were used to maintain best coding practices.

CSS was written with a focus on responsive design, ensuring that the website looks good on both mobile and desktop screens. A combination of modern UI elements—like card components, a gradient hero section, and subtle shadows—was added to give the website a polished look. Media queries were used to improve the layout for larger screens.

Git was used throughout the development process. The repository was initialized using git init, after which all files were added and committed with clear, descriptive messages. Multiple commits allowed tracking of progress and changes. The project was then pushed to a GitHub repository for hosting and submission.

Documentation was created in a separate docs/ folder to explain the project overview, the workflow, and future enhancements. This documentation supports the assignment requirement of demonstrating understanding of tools and collaboration practices.
