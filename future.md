# Future Improvements

Although the current version of the portfolio website is fully functional, several enhancements can be made in the future to make it more interactive and visually dynamic. One of the major improvements involves adding JavaScript functionality for animations, transitions, and interactive elements such as dropdown menus, modals, or a dark-mode toggle.

Another planned improvement is expanding the Projects section into a dedicated page where each project can have its own detailed write-up, screenshots, GitHub links, and live demos. This will turn the portfolio into a more professional showcase, helpful for internships and placements.

Additionally, deploying the website using GitHub Pages or Netlify would allow others to access the live version easily. Integrating form services like EmailJS or Formspree could enable functional contact forms without requiring a backend server. A downloadable PDF resume section may also be added.
